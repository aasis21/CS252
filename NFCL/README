# No-frills Cab Locator

Our project involves an app and a site that matches a customer with cab drivers with no additional features. The app serves the needs of both customers and drivers. No data about the customer whatsoever is be taken, and only the driverâ€™s name and phone number is be obtained. There is a server that does the job of matching the customer with a driver. This also handles storage, updating and deletion of driver details.
